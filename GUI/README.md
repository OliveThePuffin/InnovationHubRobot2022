# Tour Guide GUI

This project requires the `gtkmm3` and `mpv` packages to be installed.

Because this GUI uses the GTK API, it can be customized with different GTK themes

Currently the binary must be run in this dir as `bin/TGUI` or the media files won't load

TODO: fix this

Feedback: Make room selection layout show current location
